// Functions - Age calculator

/*  Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:

name – a string representing someone's name
yearOfBirth – a number representing their year of birth
currentYear – a number representing the current year
The ageCalculator function should return a string explaining how old the person is. For example, if we called ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, the return value should be as follows.
*/

//"Suzie is 32 years old."


function ageCalculator (name, yearOfBirth, currentYear) {
  let age = currentYear - yearOfBirth;
  let str = name + " is " + age + " years old."
  return str;
}

console.log(ageCalculator("Miranda", 1983, 2015));
console.log(ageCalculator("Ferdinand", 1988, 2015));
